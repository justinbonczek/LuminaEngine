Lumina Engine
============

Lumina Engine is a 3D simulation and video game engine written in C++ with Microsoft DirectX 11. It is being created with the purpose of providing a platform upon which I can learn graphics programming and engine architecture. I will be developing this engine and using it to create games over the course of my college career, and perhaps even further.

My plans for the Lumina Engine include a wide variety of features including, but not limited to:

- Full lighting functionality with Deferred Rendering
- Beautifully rendered real-time shadows
- A custom particle engine (in time, physically based)
- A variety of post-processing effects (blur, bloom, etc)
- Skeletal animations
- Subsurface scattering

... in addition to many of the basic features needed in order to render a 3D game or simulation in real-time.

The constant goal if this project is not only to maintain the codebase for a large engine, but to also ensure that it remains optimized to the best of my capabilities every step of the way. There's no point in rendering beautiful graphical effects if I cannot keep the framerate high enough to give the illusion of life, not to mention that I also have a deep interest in only creating code that is efficient and worthwhile.

For updates on this project, either check out the code in the repository or see what else I'm working on at http://www.justinbonczek.com.
